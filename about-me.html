    <h1>About Me</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Hey, I'm an amateur programmer with an interest in taking things further, I can't say my work will be the best however I can assure you that I'm always striving to do better.
    I sometimes get given the question of why I chose this path, what drives me, what makes me good for this line of work, although I really think what you want to hear is that deep down I
    long for the day I can look back on the work I've done with pride, to have taken the time to become the man others would'nt have the courage to be and to be able to show that to you, not 
    with the words here but the work I'm yet to do.</p>

    <h1>Experience</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Recently I have been focussing more on web development so I may be some what
    rusty in other areas, the current languages I know how to work with are Java, HTML and CSS.
    Java, not to be confused with JavaScript, I currently have no experience with the
    implementation of JavaScript in web pages however I may advance to it when I'm confident 
    enough with CSS and HTML, my experiences with Java go as far as simple programs however
    i'd consider myself familiar enough with the workings of it to create what is necessary if
    given the appropriate time. As for CSS and HTML you're currently looking at the first website created
    by yours truly, I don't doubt for a second it can't be better, the code is some what rushed out but
    my main focus at the time was how pretty the pages are, not the code though i may try make it cleaner some time
    in the future if I get the time.</p>
